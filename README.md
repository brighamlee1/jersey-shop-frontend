# Jersey-Closet
- https://jersey-closet.netlify.app/

This website is an NBA jersey shop where you can purchase jerseys that you would like. When you sign up, you can make a review on a jersey. You may choose the size jersey you want for that specific jersey and then add it to your wishlist. 

### Technologies Used

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB to build out this application.
